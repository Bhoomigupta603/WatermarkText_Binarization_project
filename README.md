# WatermarkText_Binarization_project
This project combines multiple techniques to detect, remove background, and binarize watermark text from images. It utilizes YOLOv8 for watermark text detection, followed by background removal using image processing techniques, and finally, text binarization using OTSU and wavelet transform methods.

Features
Watermark Text Detection: Utilizes YOLOv8 to accurately detect watermark text in images.
Background Removal: Removes the background from the detected watermark text region to isolate it.
Text Binarization: Applies OTSU and wavelet transform techniques to binarize the watermark text, enhancing its visibility and usability.
